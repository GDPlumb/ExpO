3|[1, 1, -1, 1, 1]|Condition A because the it seemed to change the price in fewer clicks. And get to the target price with less clicks.|[10, 10, 6, 3, 4]|[41, 32, 5, 17, 27]|True|Condition A the numbers seemed to hit the target price faster.|1|1|[0, -1, 1, 1, 1]|Great survey thank you.
4|[0, 1, 0, 1, -1]|Both seemed to match my expectations in some rounds, and not match in other rounds.|[4, 2, 4, 6, 12]|[2, 4, 2, 26, 8]|True|I was pretty confused by both of them.  Neither seemed very useful.|0|0|[0, 1, 0, 1, -1]|I was very confused by the task in general.

7|[1, 1, 0, 1, -1]|I also thought it was condition A. This was because I expected an inaccurate change as was said at the beginning of the task, but it was in an acceptable value and not too distant, and condition A was the one that most corresponded to my expectations, not presenting as many distortions as it presented to B.|[5, 6, 5, 7, 13]|[8, 8, 4, 10, 1]|False|Most of the time it was condition A, as it was the one that most corresponded well to my changes, making me reach the stipulated value more easily and quickly.|1|1|[1, 1, 0, 1, -1]|This was a very different study from the ones I found here, I found it very interesting and really good. Congratulations on the job!
8|[-1, -1, 0, -1, 0]|In Condition A the predictions seemed completely unrelated to how the price actually changed.|[15, 6, 2, 6, 2]|[6, 2, 2, 3, 1]|False|I could more accurately predict what the effects of changing each thing would be. |-1|-1|[-1, -1, 0, -1, 0]|

14|[0, -1, 0, 1, 1]|I feel that A operated in a manner that tended to be more predictable in nature.|[8, 3, 6, 2, 2]|[9, 3, 5, 3, 2]|False|I fond it to closely match the aligned values that were displayed.|1|1|[1, -1, 0, 1, 1]|none

18|[1, 1, 0, -1, -1]|While this one often overestimated things, it still was more accurate than condition A overall and helped me make decisions to get the answer.|[3, 3, 13, 12, 2]|[6, 6, 2, 1, 1]|False|It helped me get to the right answer easily|-1|-1|[1, 1, 1, -1, 1]|"I think using the explanation is confusing. That sounds like there is some kind of written language for the conditions so I thought I missed something. You should just use ""what condition"" or ""what algorithm"" to make it more clear."

20|[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]|Both seemed to match my expectations about the same, which is to say more often than not but sometimes the price change was unpredictable in both conditions.|[3, 4, 5, 3, 3]|[3, 2, 5, 2, 6]|False|I didn't notice a significant enough difference to find one more useful than the other.|0|0|[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]|No, thank you.

I didn't notice any significant difference, but would lean towards A if you made me  pick.|0|0|[1, 0, -1, -1, 1]|I got a little confused twice and didn't notice the sign had flipped so made a few unnecessary moves.

32|[0, 1, 1, 1, -1]|IT seemed clearer that the price would change better with a few changes on Condition A.|[3, 12, 2, 13, 7]|[3, 19, 5, 14, 12]|True|IT seemed to focus on items that may be of most important.|1|1|[0, 1, 1, 1, -1]|It was interesting, not sure how it all works, but liked the task.  Thank you.
33|[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]|Just seemed to run more true than Condition B|[8, 5, 5, 2, 5]|[10, 5, 5, 3, 5]|True|Seemed faster to get to the target most of the time|1|1|[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]|None

36|[-1, 1, 1, 0, 1]|Overall, Condition A had more instances where the numbers I clicked went up or down in a somewhat understandable and definable way. Condition B tended to feel a little backwards at times with increases leading to negative values. |[10, 4, 2, 5, 4]|[4, 11, 8, 3, 5]|True|More often than not, Condition A was the fastest one to complete and the most straight forward. I didn't have to complete a bunch of clicks in order to reach my goal. Or if I did, I usually had to do just as many on B, and sometimes more.|1|1|[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]|I felt like the two conditions weren't all that far off, but I wanted to provide a solid winner here. Based on my experiences I just felt Condition A to be the better option despite some issues with it. Sometimes the two shared the same frustrations or positive qualities, but overall, after assessing them on the whole, I felt like I had an easier time with Condition A, thus my answers!
37|[-1, -1, -1, 0, -1]|The amount that changed seemed to be better and closer to the amount it originally thought it would be. |[9, 9, 9, 2, 4]|[5, 1, 4, 1, 3]|False|The prices seemed to match closer to what it forecasted.|-1|-1|[-1, -1, -1, 1, -1]|

39|[0, 0, -1, -1, -1]|I really couldn't make a lot of sense out of either condition to create an expectation of what a change would do to the price. |[3, 8, 13, 9, 23]|[4, 2, 10, 9, 2]|False|It seems a little easier to hit the target with condition B, took less trial and error I think.|0|-1|[0, 0, 0, 0, -1]|
